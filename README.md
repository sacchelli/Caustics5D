# Caustics5D

This page contains a mathematica notebook of formal computations associated with the paper 
[_Short Geodesics Losing Optimality in Contact Sub-Riemannian Manifolds and Stability of the 5-Dimensional Caustic_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11340) by Ludovic Sacchelli.

This notebook contains the codes for the explicit formal computation of the caustic in the 5 dimensional case and its blown up domains (corresponding to parts 1, 2 and 3), as well as the singularity classification, corresponding to the methods developed in the paper.
